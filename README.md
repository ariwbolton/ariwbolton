## Hi 👋

My name is Ari, and I'm based in Berkeley, CA. I collaborate on GitHub, and host many of my publc projects here!

### 🎲 Game Solvers

I love writing little “game solvers”, for common, relatively simple games.

My favorites have been [Boggle](https://github.com/ariwbolton/boggle-search-python), [Sudoku](https://github.com/ariwbolton/game-solvers/tree/master/Sudoku), and the [Wikipedia Game](https://github.com/ariwbolton/game-solvers/tree/master/WikipediaGame).

I’ve slowly added to this list over time, going all the way back to when I began programming, so fair warning that many of them are pretty rudimentary.

### 🔐 Cryptography

At UC Davis, I had the pleasure of learning from Prof. Phillip Rogaway, who specializes in Cryptography and got me interested cryptographic protocols. (Not “crypto”!) I’ve dabbled in roles which involve cryptography, and built a Substitution Cipher breaker a couple times. The only one of note is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. 

### 📈 Stock Trading

Quite a long time ago, I built a little “stock analyzer” program. It was able to scrape some historical stock ticker data, and run some very simple algorithms on it. Just thought it was fun — do not under any circumstances use this with real money!
