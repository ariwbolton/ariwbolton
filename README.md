## Hi 👋

My name is Ari, and I'm based in Berkeley, CA. I collaborate on GitHub, and host many of my public projects here!

  <summary>🏀 NBA Elo Tracker</summary>
  
  I used to love the [538 NBA Predictions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2023-nba-predictions) project, and was sad to see it shut down sometime after the site was acquired by ESPN. So, out of frustration, I've rebuilt the Elo tracking feature because it's just plain fun to check in on throughout the season! If I were faster at building pretty UIs, it'd look a lot better. Find it [here](https://elotracker.ariwbolton.com/), on my website. If I can find the time, maybe I'll revive the playoff prediction feature, too...

<summary>🎲 Game Solvers</summary>

I love writing little “game solvers”, for common, relatively simple games.

My favorites have been [Boggle](https://github.com/ariwbolton/boggle-search-python), [Sudoku](https://github.com/ariwbolton/game-solvers/tree/master/Sudoku), and the [Wikipedia Game](https://github.com/ariwbolton/game-solvers/tree/master/WikipediaGame).

I’ve slowly added to this list over time, going all the way back to when I began programming, so fair warning that many of them are pretty rudimentary.

<summary>🔐 Cryptography</summary>

At UC Davis, I had the pleasure of learning from [Prof. Phillip Rogaway](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/), who specializes in Cryptography and got me interested cryptographic protocols. (Not “crypto”!) I’ve dabbled in roles which involve cryptography, and built a Substitution Cipher breaker a couple times. The only one of note is a [Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm](https://github.com/ariwbolton/substitution-cipher-breaker/tree/master/substitution-cipher-breaker/monte_carlo_improved).

<summary>📈 Stock Trading</summary>

Quite a long time ago, I built a little “stock analyzer” [program](https://github.com/ariwbolton/stock-analyzer). It was able to scrape some historical stock ticker data, and run some very simple algorithms on it. Just thought it was fun — do not under any circumstances use this with real money!
